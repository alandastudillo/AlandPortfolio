# [Project 2. Music Visualisation](https://github.com/) 
For this example project I built a music visualisation. 

I was able to get a chunk of samples from a spectrum estimator using the audio file as input and then I transformed this in visualisation according to the sampling rate. 

* Features:
  * Support for mp3 files
  * It allows 3 different plotting methods

* Built in MATLAB

# [Project 3. Video Analysis to obtain heart pulse signal ](https://github.com/) 
This example shows how to use Independent Component Analysis (ICA) on a video analysis to obtain pulse signal and other measures. 

* Features:
  * Support for mpeg files
  * Fast ICA method (reference here)

* Built in MATLAB
